    <blockquote cite="https://www.worldwildlife.org/">WWF’S MISSION<br>Combatting climate change means taking a hard look at how we live—reducing emissions in our daily lives and in the manufacturing, processing, and distributing of products. It also requires advocating for the implementation of climate-smart local and national policies. But increasingly, it’s not enough to do “less harm.” We also need to harness the power of nature to help fight climate change, all while providing critical benefits for people and wildlife<br>Nature gives us water and food, protects us from diseases, and supplies so many of the products we rely on every day. If we don’t take care of nature, we put all of that at risk. The same principle also applies to climate impacts. In fact, nature can be the best technology to mitigate the impacts of climate change.</blockquote>
